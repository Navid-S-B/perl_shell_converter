# Sheeple -> Converting Shell Script to Perl Scripts
sheeple.pl converts simple and indented shell scripts with if/else if/else statements, for loops, while loops,and other simple test cases!

However the code assumes a well formatted input, which is not a safe assumption as tiny semantic erros in code can result the conversion possibly breaking.

Also the style which this was implemented, was not the best style for this project, as each subset according to each subset, although all the subsets are very inter-connnected.

This is something still of interest to me, and will be updated with better perl code in the future!
